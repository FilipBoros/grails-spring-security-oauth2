Spring Security OAuth2 Plugin
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MatrixCrawler/grails-spring-security-oauth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MatrixCrawler/grails-spring-security-oauth)

Main differences with the Grails 2 plugin:

- no more dependency on https://github.com/antony/grails-oauth-scribe but some code of that plugin was ported in this

- simplest code as possible
